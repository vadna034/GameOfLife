# Conway's Game of Life in Python

This repository includes a version of Conway's Game of Life that I programmed in college

## How do I run this? 

You must have python version 3 installed on your computer. Then, running python ./gameOfLifeGUI.py while in the projects directory should get the game running

## How do I use the GUI?

Clicking on a square changes it's state. Black means alive, white means dead. Clicking run will advance the state forward one 'turn' in the game of life.
